In this project I am trying to write a game similar to vampire survivors using pygame. Next steps are:
-> add limits to the map,
-> add basic enemies and their movement (shapes with red colors)
-> add a mechanic that will allow for player to fight the enemies (shooting or swinging something)
-> mechnaic for leveling up. maybe DnD inspired stats.
-> animate characters and map elements.
-> add start, end, options screen.
